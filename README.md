# AP Comp Sci A
All of the lessons, assignments, and publicly-available documents I was given as an AP Computer Science A student at Florida Virtual School (FLVS).

## Why are some assignments missing?
Most likely because they contained personally identifiable information that I was required to add to the program/code as part of the assignment.

Less likely because I forgot to stage/commit/push the file to the Git repository.

## Why is this being open-sourced?
I just felt like other AP Comp Sci students out there could use my help, if they ever end up Googling a question or problem and find my repository.

## Does this repository also contain the answers to quizzes/tests/exams?
No. I don't want to spoonfeed answers to people, I want you to read the code and understand what it actually means. This is why I'm only open sourcing the lesson files and assignments I complete.

## Can't I just download the Java source files from this repository and upload them as my own?
That is morally impossible. Although, if you lack morals and standards, then nothing is stopping you from downloading the entire repository, changing my name and the date in the source files, and uploading the assignments as your own.

But then, what's the point of taking AP Computer Science if you're just going to plagiarize the whole way through?

Also, services like TurnItIn (which many schools use) *may or may not* flag you for plagiarism.

But at the end of the day, it's your call. I'm not encouraging you to plagiarize, in fact I'm heavily against it. But I can't stop a stranger halfway across the Earth from doing something as mundane as downloading a file (or set of files) over the Internet.
